# Challenges

The teams all decided to pick one of the following two challenges:

## Cyber Security Challenge (Civic Digits)

Create a game or an app to help someone who doesn’t know or think about cyber security

Imagine someone who never really thinks about cyber security and isn’t aware of any threat online. How could you engage them? What would be the most fun, provocative or interesting way to do either of the following?
* Tell someone something about how to stay safe online
* Encourage them to find out for themselves.
