  <h2>Important - Slight location change!</h2>
  <p>Prewired has now moved to a new, larger space within CodeBase.  To access it, please enter via the doors at 38 Castle Terrace instead of the main doors to
    Argyle house.  The new entrance is just around the corner from the old one as shown on the map below, the doors are clearly labelled with "CodeBase".</p>
