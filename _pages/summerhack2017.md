We are excited to announce that we are running **Summer Hack** again this year &mdash; a week-long team programming competition for young people of secondary school age.

The Summer Hack will take place daily August 7th&ndash;11th 2017, from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. Details of the schedule are shown below. The event will take place at [Codebase Events Space](https://goo.gl/maps/KD9Gru6wjzr), 38 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh EH3 9SJ

We still have a limited number of places, so if you want to be involved, [sign up now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgyqgtlBbllYQSVio2OHywUDGs6milG7bsPFr4mLYSjGNXBw/viewform)!

* What is involved? You will be working in a small team, working together on a small project.
* Will there be prizes? Yes. At the end of the week, each team will give a demo of their project, and prizes will be awarded in various categories.
* Do you need to bring a laptop? Not necessarily &mdash; we can provide one.
* What about food? We will provide snacks but you will need to bring your own lunch.

To get more of an idea of what will happen, check out this video of highlights from last year's Summer Hack, kindly produced for us by the awesome team at [Product Forge](https://productforge.io):

## Challenges

TBA

<!-- ### Active Coding

Design a project with a device (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.co.uk)) to help younger children learn programming.

### Chatbot Challenge

Make a [chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatterbot). Talk to a computer, have it say silly things back. You could use the [NLTK chat library](http://nltk.org/_modules/nltk/chat) as a starting point.


### The Answer

Create a programme that will ask people questions (and then do something fun with their answers, such as [generative art](https://labs.ideo.com/2014/06/04/painting-with-code/) with [Nodebox](https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Introduction)).


### Recycle Me!

Build a web site or mobile app that encourages people to recycle more stuff for [City of Edinburgh Council](http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20001/bins_and_recycling).

### True Grit

Build a game that makes it fun to find [grit bins](http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20227/gritting_and_salt_bins/) in Edinburgh, and to check that the location on the Council map is their real location. (You can also use [OpenStreetMap](http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/hJ6) to record [grit bin](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dgrit_bin) locations.)

### Website Upgrade

Work on the Prewired website and learn about [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), CSS, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org), Git and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

### Give Me Shelter

Create an interactive digital adventure about what it's like to be homeless.

### Library Games

Create a game that takes place in a library.

### Swap your stuff! 

Create an app or website where you can offer clothes, toys, gadgets in exchange for things that other people want to get rid of. (Or donate them to [Shelter](http://scotland.shelter.org.uk).)

### Digital Play

Build a game that is suitable for very young children.
Take into account recent research from the University of Edinburgh about [Exploring play and creativity in pre-schoolers’ use of apps](/assets/exploring_play.pdf).

### Lego robots! 

Can your robot do this?
