### Contact

You can contact the organisers by emailing hello@prewired.org.

Don't forget to sign up for the [newsletter](#newsletter) to stay up to date with the latest developments!

You can also send [@prewired](http://twitter.com/prewired) a message on Twitter; the Twitter account is run by volunteer participants.

### Community

We're in the process of setting up our very own private social network. Stay tuned to the newsletter for more information!

Meanwhile, participants and mentors can join the [prewired-discuss Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prewired-discuss) or the [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/prewired).

We also have an IRC channel (server: irc.imaginarynet.uk, channel: #prewired); you'll need to ask a mentor for the password.

### Mentors

Mentors can join the [prewired-helpers Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prewired-helpers).
