Prewired every day! Mentors were around to help Prewired participants work on whatever cool project they wanted, and there were some great outcomes! [A note about it on Amy's blog](http://rhiaro.co.uk/2015/04/prewired-maker).

**19th April 2015 - Mini Maker Faire**

The [Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfaireedinburgh.com/) was an event in **Summerhall**, Edinburgh, on Sunday 19th April. We had a table to show off the variety of interesting projects that happen at Prewired. Kids attended as 'crew' to show off their work and tell people about Prewired. They did an amazing job!

**4th March 2015 - Beginners Android Development**

Learn the basics of how to make your first Android app with members of Scotland's largest mobile app development agency, [Kotikan](http://kotikan.com). Over the course of the evening we'll introduce key concepts required to create an Android app and work with you as you build your own simple product.

Before you come, if possible, install the following on your laptop (follow the links for instructions):

* [Android Studio and the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio)
* [GenyMotion](https://www.genymotion.com) (plugin to Android studio)

*No prior experience with Android or Java necessary! (But it also won't hurt)*
